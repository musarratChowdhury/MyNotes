how can i turn off a typescript error

There are a few ways to turn off a TypeScript error depending on the situation:

    Using the // @ts-ignore comment: You can add this comment above the line of code that is causing the error, and it will tell the TypeScript compiler to ignore the error.
```
// @ts-ignore
const myVar = someFunctionThatReturnsAny();
```
    Using the // @ts-nocheck comment: You can add this comment at the top of your file to tell the TypeScript compiler to skip checking this file altogether.
```
// @ts-nocheck
const myVar = someFunctionThatReturnsAny();
```
    Using the // @ts-expect-error comment: You can add this comment above the line of code that is causing the error, and it will tell the TypeScript compiler to expect an error, but continue checking the rest of the file.
```
// @ts-expect-error
const myVar = someFunctionThatReturnsAny();
```
    Using the // @ts-ignore-next-line comment: You can add this comment above the line of code that is causing the error, and it will tell the TypeScript compiler to ignore the error and continue checking the next line.
```
const myVar = someFunctionThatReturnsAny();
// @ts-ignore-next-line
myVar.someNonExistentMethod();
```
    Using the // @ts-ignore-all-next-line comment: You can add this comment above the line of code that is causing the error, and it will tell the TypeScript compiler to ignore all errors on the next line.
```
const myVar = someFunctionThatReturnsAny();
// @ts-ignore-all-next-line
myVar.someNonExistentMethod();
```
Please keep in mind that these techniques should be used sparingly and with caution, as they can make it harder to
